so the current task list: 

- set up some venv tools
- create directory structure
    - so there are challenges to build a roguelike in like seven day 
- read through first couple chapters of this tutorial

tutorial is: http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

we'll be using something called tcod
this will probably be much harder than I'd really like it to be so I'm setting my expectations very low.
